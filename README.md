# Overview of the analysis

## Purpose
the pupose of this analysis is to analyze and create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results

#### By reviewing the summary above we can see that there are several key findings including:

Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.

Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities.

Suburban cities have 6x + drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.

Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.

The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides.

Rural Pyber users on average should expect to pay more for rides. Cities by nature have higher populations, leading to a bigger driver pool and allowing Pyber users to get lower fares.

As the image above shows urban areas were by far the biggest generators of fares for Pyber.

## Summary
Based on the analysis i would recomend Pyber to create some type of incentive program to try to increase the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand.
Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and urban cities.This could indicate that rural area based drivers are charging more this could be due to longer rides or limited drivers in the are. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business.
